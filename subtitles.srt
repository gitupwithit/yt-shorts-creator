World leaders, particularly America and China, are taking AI seriously.

00:0:06,000 --> 00:0:12,000
Biden and Xi Jinping have already held talks about it.

3
00:0:12,000 --> 00:0:19,000
The fact that these world powers are discussing AI is promising.

4
00:0:19,000 --> 00:0:26,000
The UN Secretary General even mentioned that he's open to creating an international body for AI research.

5
00:0:26,000 --> 00:0:35,000
This cooperation could create a strong foundation for global AI governance.

00:5:00,000 --> 00:5:06,000
A recent study involving 2,700 AI researchers predicted job automation by 2100.

00:5:06,000 --> 00:5:11,000
However, that doesn't align with the rapid advancements we're witnessing.

00:5:11,000 --> 00:5:17,000
Job automation is likely to come much sooner than anticipated.

Mustafa Suleyman was asked if AI could take over humanity.

12
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,000
He decisively shut down that idea, stating there is no likelihood of such an outcome.

13
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,000
This contradicts the common fear many have about AI.

14
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:26,000
His assurance is significant coming from someone behind major AI advancements.

15
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's encouraging to see industry leaders aligning with a positive view on AI's future.
